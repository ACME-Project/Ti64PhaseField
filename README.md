# Ti64PhaseField
Phase field codes for modeling phase transformations in Ti-6Al-4V

1.) The source codes sp-xmpf, sp-initialize, and sp-graingrowth represent a working example of integration of tensor capability into a simple multi phase field model. The specific tensor related codes can be found in tensor.hpp and eigenstrains.hpp

2.) The source code Ti64-1D.cpp, and related, represent the coupling of composition and phase fields into a MMSP setup.
