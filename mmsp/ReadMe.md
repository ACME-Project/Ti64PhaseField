### Implementation of phase field models on MMSP. 

### Note: All the files require one or multiple mmsp include files. Give attention to the path for such files on the makefile before compiling.

#### Components added to the model: Explicit nucleation, strain energy of phase transformations, coupling with thermo databases, anisotropic gradient energy coefficient. 

#### Component of the model under construction: Interfacial dynamics.
